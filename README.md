A self-paced, interactive browser-based guide designed to introduce students to game development using the **Godot Engine (v4)**.

This course takes students from "zero" to a fully functional **Pong** clone, covering the essentials of the engine, GDScript, and game logic.

## 📚 Course Content

The material is divided into two main modules accessible via the main menu:

1.  **Introduction (`intro.html`):**
    *   Why use Godot?
    *   Installation (Standard Version).
    *   Interface overview (Scene Dock, FileSystem, Inspector).
    *   Core concepts: Nodes & Scenes.

2.  **Pong Guide (`pong-guide.html`):**
    *   **Step-by-Step Tutorial:** Building the game from scratch.
    *   **Setup:** Project creation and window settings.
    *   **Physics:** Creating the Paddle and Ball (CharacterBody2D).
    *   **Scripting:** Basic GDScript for movement and collision (`move_and_slide`, `move_and_collide`).
    *   **Logic:** Simple score tracking without complex signals.
    *   **Export:** How to publish the game to the web.
